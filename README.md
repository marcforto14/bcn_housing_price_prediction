# Barcelona Housing Price Prediction
This project explains the creation of a Machine Learning model to forecast housing prices in Barcelona using real data from Idealista, complemented by social and economic data sourced from OpenData Barcelona.

The first part of the report describes the preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and imbalanced variables, analyzing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. It then details the feature selection techniques used, from where we extracted relevant information of housing prices.

Finally, the modeling section is addressed, implementing multiple models such as Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict housing price categories. Each model is evaluated based on precision, recall, and F1-scores, with RFC obtaining the best results.
